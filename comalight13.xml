<Trivia>Attention: I'm an asshole and most likely don't like that crap that you name art. Therefore i give bad votes, anonymously to cause more drama. However, feel free to think the same about my releases.

First joined Climax but after the group and the HQ got very inactive and i arrived as the only member at The Party 4, i got rather pissed off. On the Party 94 i met with the guys from Metalvotze that have freshly founded (i knew Drago already before that) and so i joined them. Equinoxe was just an intermezzo due to being frustrated with Climax in the end. As Metalvotze meanwhile consists only of a few active members who do all the great releases, i thought i'd better share the fame with better groups, like Oxyron.</Trivia>

<Text>Watched it yesterday for n-th time!
...and I don't know what makes it #1 demo for me ever!
is it Unbelievable code?
perfect Fanta's soundtrack?
or amazing gfx that Veto did (actually I know how much work it was!) - just WoW !!!

All these things put together makes this an AMAZING demo. 
Still #1 for me after all these 7 years!

simply put, they are... Oxy ... Oxy ... Oxy.

ps.
hold your horses because, badge #0 demo for me is  still "Unboxed" ;) :P</Text>

<Handle>Raistlin</Handle>
<HandleStory>I was a big fan of the Dragonlance books at the time and chose my handle early into those. The character later became dark, and ill, from what I can remember, but that just gave the name even more of an edge.</HandleStory>
<Scener><ID>832</ID>
<Country>United Kingdom</Country>
<Trivia>Pre-scene, Raistlin was well known to be the number one POKEster (with more published POKEs than any other) for the English mags ZZAP!, Commodore User, CCI, What Poke and various other gaming mags - thanks to a constant day-one (or earlier) supply of video games. All POKEs were either printed under his real name or his alter-ego, Kipperman.

An old-schooler, Raistlin joined the demo scene in 1988 with his brother, Kreator (&amp;lt;scener id=7835&amp;gt;), creating the SCC (Silsden Cracking Crew) group... the talent-finding Pyrotech picked him up - which later became Excess.

He jumped between a few groups with short stints in Rough Trade, NATO and Oneway... and then eventually joined Genesis Project.

Following the release of Delirious 10, his last demo, Raistlin quit the scene... there was a brief blip after meeting with the Xentrix guys where he joined their group - but then never actually did anything... Giving his old C64 to a cousin, he went off to University and wasn't seen again .. until ...

27 years later, in 2018, he rejoined G*P and released his first new demo at Gubbdata 2018: Delirious 11, and ended up as #4 at X the same year with X Marks the Spot.

Raistlin has been in the games industry since 1994 and has worked on many games - Destruction Derby, Test Drive 4, 5, 6 and Test Drive Overdrive, Big Air, Demolition Racer, Demolition Racer: No Exit, LA Rush, Wheelman and then more recently on Unreal Engine, Infinity Blade, the Gears of War series and much more.

He became General Manager of Epic Games UK after Epic bought his company, Pitbull Studio, in 2014. Since then he's started a new company that has worked on Lawbreakers, Conan: Exiles and Sea of Thieves amongst others.</Trivia>

<Text>After couple days of listening the tunes in my car I could finally concentrate on music rather then fx in the demo (which are of course great, but everybody knows it ;-) ).
The music is absolutely fantastic! The tunes contain many styles, many sounds, many details. It's an overview of the sounds from entire scene history (including the games). They're very dynamic and fits the demo flow perfectly. One of the best demo soundtracks ever! Not easy to create such masterpiece I suppose, but Fanta is just one of the best.
Can't wait for another Oxyron demo with Fanta on the keys...</Text>

<Trivia>I've been involved with C64 since back in the day although I never was as active on "the scene" as I am today.

In 2009 I rediscovered 8-bit, after having had a 13-year long break. On a local party I stumbled upon familiar faces &amp;lt;scener id="612"&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;scener id="990"&amp;gt; - which ultimately led me to &amp;lt;group id="132"&amp;gt; in late 2010.

I have a strong interest in preservation and scene research in general, and of course TRIAD in particular.</Trivia>

<Trivia>Got his first c64 in 1986. Did some c64-swapping 89-91, until he followed Jack Tramiel to the Atari ST (handles Mr.Marvel and Julgran until 1993). 2009 c64 saved him back to the right path. In 2010 he joined Genesis Project as graphician and helped Sixx rebuilding the group. Quickly he was doing more original supplies than gfx, and became the main original supplier of GP the same year. In 2011 he became GP co-organizer and 2012 organizer. 

He is also into preserving old releases, and between 2010-2019 he uploaded ~15 000 releases, and added 1000+ sceners and about 520 groups to CSDb.

<Text>A great demo in all aspects.   Great GFX music and code.

In particular i like the usage of mixed hires and mcolor chars in the intro logo's and turn disk part.

Transitions are great with the parts i liked the most are the vector shadow trailblazer section, twister, and that great looking parallax section.   Nice digi part at the end as well. Very clear multichannel samples with SID</Text>

<Text>Well, this demo is great, the graphics are pure awesome, but it could've used a more consistent design and more content, like EoD.

Still, I believe EoD deserves the #1 spot on the top 10, but that's my opinion.

@Shadow: It's not your imagination, it IS more high-quality, probably because THCM gave them some Vicious Sid Magic :P</Text>

<Text>I have to write another comment on this. The first time I saw it I was blown away, and it just gets better and better every time I see it. The whole demo is fantastic so I won't mention any special part... hmm, ok I will.. the greetings part is (still) a real beauty and very original. The intro is totally awesome and so polished. And everything in between and after, perfect. I can't see that I will ever get tired of watching this.</Text>

<Text>Fantastic demo with impressive effects, starting right off the bat with the fake-Booze part, that plasma somehow looks subpixel-smooth!

Then the shadow vector, the amazing parallax part, and the vector-with-balls that looks like something from an Amiga demo - superb!

Also, I'm not sure why, but I think the samples ("Coma Light" at the begining) sounds so much clearer than what I usually hear in sample parts on C64. Perhaps just my imagination though... :)</Text>

<Text>W O W !!
With Axis, Bitbreaker, Peiselulli and now also the human code machine all in one group, everything is possible.

Technically the best C64 demo ever, a deserved winner. The intro took my breath away, the tension gets higher and higher and for me personally the climax is highest when it reaches the credits part (that I watched like 20 minutes, but no greetings in my direction.. a weak spot of the demo ;-).
Also the music of the credits part is simply awesome.
What then follows left me speachless again, the "the best looking parallax part ever made" is in my humble opinion the best looking effect ever made, and the transitions are so smooth that I could hardly recognize the changes happening.
But then, despite being technically brilliant like the rest, the music reduces the demo atmosphere for me. 
Usual demo musics sometimes have the problem that they are not much timed to the demo - now it's the opposite problem: the music is so much timed to the demo that it becomes merely sound effects at times. While in other demos the music is the glue that binds unrelated parts together to a whole it now separates the parts. 
My conclusion is that you will have to make coma light 14 one day to end the series with an all perfect sequal... ;-)

Some personal highlights for me:
- fantastic intro grabbing me instantly
- best looking demopart ever ("paralax")
- the credits part (gfx, code, msx and ideas are all fantastic)
- an OYS inspired picture from Yazoo</Text>

<Text>Comalight 13 was released and I was there, yeah:)
Congratulations to the crew, the demo has the true comalight style with lots of great effects.
Demo starts with cool graphics and the shadow cube looks really great.
Turn disk graphics are magnificent and carpetlike effects are also really cool.

And "the best looking parallax part ever made" comes to screen. What a wonderful scene.
I especially liked bezier-like water part, really original. Also graphic-design in this screen is quite cool. 

Pool-water effect is one of my favorites in the demo. The vectors with the circles look really great.

Negative things are; the demo looks a bit unfinished at the end, puppet part, fractals and end part looks like something independent from the demo.
I think soundtrack has some weak points too. Lots of effects used with really good synch but some effects sound bad and music always changes during the demo causing incoherency.

Overall Comalight 13 was by far the best demo in the compo and was the clear choice for the 1st place.  This demo got its place in my personal top 10.</Text>

It's the loser's fate:
Death through Thunderblade.
It's what the dark beasts hate:
The power of Thunderblade.
It's what the liars are afraid:
That they one day meet... Thunderblade.

But for the good ones it's never too late
to join the force of Thunderblade.
There's a new dimension's gate:
It leads to... Thunderblade.</Trivia>

<Text>Have seen it a couple of times now - of course on real hardware. :) It's the surprise of the year for me. Thanks so much for making me happy! ;) I agree with my brother-in-law on this one: The music is very good, but PRI(alike) soundtrack would have made it perfect. Also, I personally enjoyed the loading screens of Coma Light 12, they had those special semi-provoking character. :) Sorry, can't write more now - gotta restart the demo on my C64!</Text>

Love the Coma light 13 intro graphics thingies, and funny Booze spoof. Greetings are amazing.

Alas, I already took it off for EoD.

for me, only missing thing was Graham's participation. i really wanted to see at least one part from him. but congratulations to the rest of the team for making masterpiece parts and covering Graham's absence.

i may write a part by part review later but for the moment, i want to mention two highlights for me. cube with shadow and parallax scrolling. both of these parts shocked my boozed out brain cells at the party. guys, i just love you. :)</Text>

<Text>PAL: afaik there is no proper tool existing for creating charmode based pictures. so i decided to work in multiple steps.

the logos themselves are designed in [url=http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=74132]mapeddi 2[/url], which is supposed for creating game gfx backgrounds, supports up to 3 charsets and splits can be set individually. unfortunately it uses 2x2 blocks and colormaps are assigned to blocks not chars. so when the logos were done i made excel sheets (no joke) with the charmap and others with color assignment per charset/char. the charsets themselves were ripped from the mapeddi file.</Text>

<Text>PAL: the intro logo(s) were pixelled by veto who is our charmode-master :)  i have "only" done the creditz logos which are not charmode. i think veto has his very own tool from his old games-company (bonespark software artistic) from back in the days, which is a c64 tool. but he may have more informations depending on that and the workflow.</Text>

<Text>yazoo... the logo effect is chars right... is there any tool that is great to work in 3 color char mode but play around with color mappings per char... other than p1... I meen if I create a logo in 3 colors and then want to just alter the color map... what tool did you use? A special one that you have or something that is open? It is cool effect and reminded me that in the past I used to do such color alterations per mapped color per char... So any hints it would rule...

Thanx again for a great show and a powerful big cool demo!</Text>

<Text>HCL, dont you worry from a coders (my) perspective this is not an EOD killer. BUT the best demo since it :) Personally I'm a bit disappointed, the demo tech level wasnt much raised on this X, I have also some stuff in my bag to show 'em how a real coder does it ;), but a kid to raise now aswell, god knows when will I find time to get together a big act again :) Anyway this demo &amp; the others on X was a huge motivation for me, I kinda felt the scene is fading away, but it was just me not having time :)</Text>

<Text>Now i have watched it a few more times and, well.. It will be easily beaten :). People seem to compare this with EoD, and so be it, but have in mind that i had to bear with 6-7 year old parts in there. This demo was made in 1-2 years and still there are weak parts (!). Music and graphics are flawless, but we in Booze will show those coders how to do their homework soon.. We just have to raise our kids first ;).</Text>

<Text>Watching this demo was one of the high points of my scene life. The moment I saw the coma light 13 title on the screen I got goosebumps. 

Comalight series have been one of my biggest inspirations growing up. I remember thinking to my self "I want to be TTS when I grow up" :) especially CL10 and CL12 are demos that I still regularly watch today. So it was immensely exciting to see this and even more so to see ourselves greeted in it. 

the boozed out part is an awesome example of the competitive spirit of the scene. and the way you guys open the demo proper with the shadowcasting vectors. TRUE COMA LIGHT style!!! I can't think of a coma light without proper amount of math code. And math code you delivered my friends :)

The graphics were also soo epic. I later found out many of them are charsets and that is just insane. Veto is a GOD!!! 

This was head and shoulders above everything else in the compo. congrats

And it is exciting to have Oxyron back with such force after so many years. We are very fired up to compete with you guys in upcoming demos.

absolute respect. </Text>

<Text>Great stuff! BTW, there are some problems with my 1541Ultimate-II when using the freeze to change disk side - after returning from Ultimate's menu, the demo crashes, but going back to the Ultimate-menu and back to the demo a few times makes the demo continue! Of course I'm not saying this Ultimate-related problem is the demo's fault! Does anybody else have problems with this demo and their Ultimate? Apart from this and a couple of other demos stuff works fine on my setup.</Text>

This prod. had great music, WOW! killers effects and neat graphics. Great synching to in some parts. Some parts in this demo are to different though to stay coherent. (If i may find something to bitch at) But WTF bring on more of these demos. Oxyron for the scene dot org award! 10/10</Text>

<HandleStory>I was looking for a cool and suitable handle and got a "celtic" sticker to my hands (was it a clothing company back in the days?). I really digged that word and had absolutely no clue about its meaning. Years later (around early 90's) I recognized that another scener (Hi Celtic! ;-) was around used the same nick. So I simply decided to keep the awespme handle and just added "design" as suffix. At that time the word "design" were used in combination by many supberb groups such as censor, panoramic, cosmos, MDG...</HandleStory>

Back in the day, my first handle for the scene was "Dok", which was only a banal distortion of the more common "Doc". After 2 years so I decided to change to Raistlin but unfortunately there was another more popular scener with the same nick. Then I decided to move to "Mustaine" and I was quite happy to realize that there were almost no other sceners around with the same handle. The choice has been made to tribute the leader of metal band Megadeth (Dave Mustaine) which was one of my favourite Tampa Bay Area thrash metal bands at that time.</HandleStory>

<Text>Ok, had a good night's sleep and seen it a few times more. More comments! :-)

It's a ridiculously good demo, no doubt about it. I think Fanta has done better soundtracks (Panta Rhei!) but that's mainly a matter of personal preference I guess. It beats most demo soundtracks anyway.

The code is of course really good, but there were fewer complete jaw-dropper effects for me than in Pimp My Snail for example. I think the best effects were the ball-vector thing (total stunner in the compo!), the huge parallax scroller and the dithered hires vectors.

On the other hand I feel that the wobbling scroller looked a bit rushed. I can't help but think that the trig table offset and direction of movement could've been better adapted to where the disco ball hit.

I also think there was some graphical incoherence - namely, Veto's hires graphics being so different in style to the rest of the graphics in the demo. It made me feel that another demo was running along with the main one, during the (otherwise excellent) puppet animation sequence.

All in all it's the best demo in the compo, but for me it lacked that extra effort on polish/art direction and a couple more killer effects to take it to the absolute top. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the coder charts, though... :-)</Text>

<HandleStory>My first nickname was Short-Circuit and I did use this one in the demo group 'Future Technologics 2009'. My second handle was G-Force.

<Trivia>I had contact with the C64 Scene since 1984 and I was in the demo group 'Future Technologics 2009' from 1987-1991 as swapper. In 1988 I did start to compose music, first in the Future Composer. 
After this I used Voicetracker. I did teach myself composing learning by doing. I play not any music instrument, that I did not learn any music instrument can sometimes be a advantage but sometimes also a pain.

In 1991 I stopped with the C64 and I moved to the PC. I made quite alot tunes on the PC with the Scream Tracker, some Scream Tracker tunes was uploaded on some Mailboxes.

1998 I found my C64 in a hidden place and I made some tunes for my own pleasure in the Soundbooster from Midas. Between 1998 - 2003 I made some PC-Songs with a other music-edior. 

Around 2003 I found in the net some Scene pages and finally in 2004 I rejoined the C64 Scene as Musician. 
I was very happy that the JCH Editor was now free available and I must say that JCH was with his JCH Editor miles before its time(maybe Time-Machine).

G-Fellow did leave the C64 scene on 02.02.2014

I think the way to go is shown by Hitmen with Artphosis. To make demos with a very good design. Even you do a big demo with not the uber code, but with alot work for the design and presentation. Don't get me wrong, I talk in general for other demos made in the future, the demo Artphosis has alot amazing code. But for other people that maybe not have yet the skills, they could try to make more design and a good story instead of the uber code. Ofcourse many other groups have shown in the past to do great demos with a great design&amp;story, Booze Design, Triad, Fairlight, Offence and many more. When I did read "...I wonder what is next!" than came only into my mind to do more demos with a great design and presentation. I think you can use Krill loader also with oldschool code+effects, you could make a story demo with great newschool design and oldschool code.

I voted for Coma Light 13 10/10 because it is a milestone.</Text>

<Text>Great demo and what an intro!
Polished to the brim.  I love the usage of mixed hires/mcol char gfx.  This has rarely been done properly.
Music in the end part with the digi's excellent with great audio quality!</Text>

<Trivia>Guess the first time I saw a demo was in late 1987 or early 1988, when one of my friends got an Amiga, and besides a lot of games he also got something called "demos", which seemed to be some cool little programs that demonstrated the amazing capabilities of this new wonder machine in creative ways. These were prods like Techtech/Sodan and whatever was available in these early days.

A neighbor of his had a C64, and told us that he also got some demos for that platform. We went over to check them out, expecting them to be utterly lame compared to Amiga demos, but after seeing stuff like Happy New Year/Starion, we were quite positively surprised. It was mostly simple stuff like rasterbars, scrollers and sine sprites, but everything seemed a lot smoother, more colorful and cooler than what one would expect, based on the general standard of C64 games.

That fascinated me a lot, and even though I didn't know much about computers back then, I got the feeling that there were a lot of unused possibilities in this old machine, and I got the urge to find out how the effects were done, and if there might be even more potential to explore.

So demos was what I wanted to do when I got my own c64 in 1988, and started learning the art of BASIC programming, and later machine code. In 1990 I had finally made some effects that I thought were good enough to be released, but didn't know anyone who were really in the demoscene, so I decided to contact Demotion, who advertised for "members wanted" all over their demo Piece of Art 3.

To my amazement they accepted me, and shortly after I got my first three parts released in "The New Style". In december 1990 I attended my first party (Dexion Xmas Conference) which was quite a nice experience. The winner of the party was Light with Brutal 3, where they wrote that some of the members were starting a new Danish group called Camelot. This sounded promising to me and Slammer, who was also in Demotion at the time. So we deliberately tried to get headhunted by writing our addresses as well as "headhunting welcome" in the scrollers of the next demo. And it worked. First to contact us was Bonzai, but shortly after Glasnost called, and it didn't take much persuation to join Camelot.

After some solid years of demo coding I got kinda bored of it in the mid 90's. Not that I decided to quit the scene - I just lost the motivation, and thought it was time to get on with my life and all that jazz. In 2000, while checking out some demos on emulator I also came across a cross assembler, and decided for fun to try if I could still remember how it was done. At first it was like I had forgotten it all, even what register controlled the border color, but it all quickly came back. And so did the motivation, since there was no getting around that this still was the most fun thing ever, and continues to be to this day.</Trivia>

what a fucking beautiful demo!!! truly excellent everything. a fast pace where you continue to get slapped in the face with bar-raisers in practically every part. also supersmooth transitions and superb design will make me want to watch this again and again!

a worthy winner for sure and possibly the next best demo of alltime.

congrats again!

Great stuff.. very nice demo.. and certainly top 10 worthy!

Graphics are polished and amazing, coding is great and love all the detail work there too.. And the soundtrack is nice.. 

But that's it.. I am honnest (and sober) enough to say that Fanta is not Dane.. and this demo would have had to have a better soundscore to be considdered an EoD killer.</Text>

<HandleStory>'Zeldin' as handle has been used from the very first day on, in all C64 scene stuff I was involved in.

<Trivia>My first appearance in the C64 Scene was in early 1987, when I did some lame cracks and demos. Some of them as solo project under my handle and some of them together with my classmate &amp;lt;scener id=859&amp;gt;, with whom I teamed up later when we founded our first group &amp;lt;group id=5981&amp;gt;. After some cracks, that all seem to be lost, the group somehow vanished due to our lameness. Then there was &amp;lt;group id=4591&amp;gt;. A loose project, Ray and me were running (partly the same time we had the other groups) in order to make games. We did two or three of'em, using 'Garry Kitchen's GameMaker', btw :-)

In the end of 1988 I founded &amp;lt;group id=1285&amp;gt;. I first thought about naming the group 'Paranoia', but after some days I decided for 'Inner City' instead. A name, I later rated being unhandy, so I renamed it with a gentle wipe into &amp;lt;group id=1279&amp;gt; in May 1989, which lasted until 'V-Lucid' was dissolved in January 1995. In between these 6 years I did many lame demos, some neat cracks (jewel version stuff) and a famous series of tool collections...

From 1988 to 1990 I was also working for the German broadcaster WDR as freelance editor and got involved in the planning and production of the once famous TV computer show called [url=http://csdb.dk/event/?id=733]Highscore[/url]. 1989/90 I also took a short step into Amiga scene, when I was a member of the Amiga group called 'Frankfort Masters (FFM)' as graphician. There is still at least one release (688 Attack Sub) out there, that contains one of my logos (hey Mookie and the rest of 'FFM', what's up, mates? :-)

In 1995 I met &amp;lt;scener id=762&amp;gt;, which was a lucky instance, as we became good friends. The same goes for &amp;lt;scener id=2607&amp;gt;, whom I met in 1996. Together we ran the group &amp;lt;group id=364&amp;gt; since today...</Trivia>

<Text>Not so epic as Comalight 12 which had totally testosterone overdosed masculine soundtrack made by PRI. Yes it has some macho moments, for example (WARNING SPOILERS) "insulting" intro, but later the tone of the demo mixed light mood with serious. Not to speak about the fact that it had that nostalgiac babbling at the end (the last comalight demo? you are kidding me right?) instead of (e.g.) shooting you in the knee with arrow of vector dude dancing to insane rave soundtrack. ...

This is no doubt masterpiece. Extremely polished, smoothly timed and very playful on all levels (gfx, animation, msx, code). 

To me, this one is a bit Better than Edge of Disgrace, which in some places had some things for sake of having things, but I'm still looking for something that has (how them artsy fartsy people call it?) narrative discourse reaching in greater distances than overscan of an average C64 monitor.

I'm going to rewatch it again just to punish myself, for being asshole, writting these blasphemic words and not shutting up to *just* show huge appreciation to Axis, Bitbreaker, Peiselulli, Fanta, Veto and Yazoo for being still so *f-word* awesome in 2012. 

ah.. and yes. Straight 10!</Text>

<Trivia>I got in touch with C64 for the first time in 1990 when I was playing a game called SEAFOX,my first experience with a computer.Suddenly in 1996 I got my first C64 although broken but got a working one meanwhile.Originaly I didn't want the C64 but I was curious ,what it is capable of compared to NES.In the end of the year 1996 I was gaming a lot and in the spring in 1997 I started to coding in Basic.Basic learned a lot,especially for my engine calculations, for the 2 Strokes in that time.The next step was assembler,but problem was that I had no sources,only few info from the diskmags and a lack of documentation and most of friends they got rid of their C64 years ago.Later on I got in touch with the guys from Unreal and things come up smoothly.By now Im focusing mainly for fixing releases to support IDE64 and developing hardware extensions for C64.</Trivia>

Ridiculously good demo. Top notch graphics, code and music. (@Fanta: You've kept the secret to the last minute, while talking to us , eh? :) ).
Thank you for raising the bar again!

Somehow the plots part looks similar to mine in Late Ejaculation. Must count the dots. :)

And by the way: so much code pr0n and nothing about effects in the demo note? Come on :)

<Text>a total hammersmash right into the face during the compo, it so much rocked on the bigscreen. I am happy that you suckers finally won the x-party :-D
Even when Ulli dislikes coding, I have to admit that the perspective scroller was mindblowing, I simply love it. The vectorpart with the balls was awesome, too, fantastic greetings part, well somehow everything rocked. I am very happy that all the hard work paid off in the end finally. very nice soundtrack by fanta, great pixels.  </Text>

<Text>Truly awesome!! Axis knows by now that saving any efforts will not do for a great compo like this ;). You all in Oxyron deserve to win this compo, even thought i think there were more demos that probably did..

Now i only watched this demo once late last night, so i can not really tell exactly how awesome each effect was, just that the over all impression was knocking me quite hard :).

But.. where is master Graham?</Text>

<Text>Some of the most mindblowing audiovisuals ever, especially in the introduction, makes it a worthy winner. The only downside (beside that horrible music at the very start :D) is a small lack of coherence all the way through - it's more like you're zapping through some channels with great but different shows running. Terrific work, Oxyron!</Text>

<Text>Superb demo! Love it! Those vectors with the balls are awesome, very well executed and the water and the magic carpet! Lovely stuff. Also that attention to the small graphical details are really cool and the greetings screen was out of this world. Anyway, amazing as it was it still doesn't cut it. It's "just" a 9. However, by adding that awesome basic fade together with the ubercool plasma and the ph4t z4k for the first 30 seconds you actually rose above your own standards and finally got the well deserved 10 straight from my heart! &amp;lt;3</Text>

<Text>Very unexpected suprise to see yet another Coma Light in such fashion. I have to admit, it brought a few tears to my eyes as well...
I checked the demo several times, still digesting some effects to understand fully. :) That vector part with the 4 balls are some unbelievable stuff for sure. :)
Design wise, very well timed to excellent music all way through, good transitions, full of very good gfx and ideas. Good job everyone involved, and thanks!

<Trivia>When I was around 7, my uncle Jasiek (RIP) bought Commodore C16, equipped with datasette (of course!) I instantly fell in love with that toy, but because I couldn't have it, I've nicked all his Bajtek magazines (polish equivalent of Byte Magazine) instead Â I could hardly read but somehow all the listings of programs seem to look nice to me. Few years later my dad brought my very own Commodore C64 breadbox from Germany (actually, I still need to ask where did he get it from, I suppose fleamarket) Â I've had played games for a few months but I quickly got bored with them. I felt it deeply in my gut Â I needed to code.

I begged my father again for weeks till he got me 1541-II disk drive; it costed something about 1,999,999 z&amp;#322; those days (yes, it was nearly 2 million polish zlotys!) I was in heaven Â started swapping 5,25" disks with stangers on pirates' local markets, getting more stuff. It occasionally happened that a disk would contain a demo. Woah! Certainly that was far more interesting than some lousy shoot 'em ups. Also, I've bought absolutely every issue of C&amp;A (Commodore &amp; Amiga Â hi Jetboy) and Kebab magazine (hi and thanks to Polonus and Silver Dream) Â these were the best titles on the market Â and I've learnt how to program in Basic 2.0.

Few years later (I was about 13 then) I started exploring MOS 6502 and the whole world of assembler. I found about demoscene, called myself Digger and founded my own group called Atlantic and went to some crazy booze copy/demo parties to win/lose some demo competitions. I was also shown how to use tracker and write SID 6581 music (thanks Ivanhoe) for the first time. Exciting times they were, we've hardly slept for 3 days!
Few people had a huge impact on me those days (thanks Carrion, Shogoon, Brush and Hain), few helped me a lot (thank you Toaster, Branzol, Morris and Druid). Please remember no one had heard about internet, BBS was a luxury so we had to swap disks via post (snailmail). I always used to attach a few pages written by hand, can't imagine how I've done that then Â it's hard to find time to write an email nowadays! Sincere thanks to Wozio for giving me a hard lesson how not to be an arse!</Trivia>

<Text>Has anyone noticed a "new" case-use for an underestimated graphic mode that Veto used brilliantly for intro logos and the comics part? It's a tricky one to draw (hires+multi together) but I am glad to see such an amazing execution.

@OXY Guys:
This demo blew my pants last nite at the compo. And I wasn't even drunk. Masterpiece! I dreamt about such a smooth one for years.
You've raised the bar high.

PS And somehow I've intuitively guessed you'll call it Coma Light 13 ;-)</Text>

<Text>What to say really? To condense the sentences into one word which I haven't used before? Such as: Splendid, excellent, fabulous and superb!
This is a very clever audio-visual presentation, down to the note. If one dreamt this in the 90:is and the early 00's, it finally came true. You got every referential piece in there if you want. With these pieces from the X'2012, this impossibly small platform and numerous people yet show that - - - Everything is possible still!</Text>

<Text>Greatness. The perfect balance between slick design &amp; gfx, soundtrack, nice codez, humor and timing. All OXY dudes are truly skilled in their diciplines. The soundtrack synch with fx is just insane. Best demo of X2012, and the new standard for modern demos!

Still... no EoD killer... or? ;-)</Text>

<Trivia>I am not a scener. I am a meta scener... Like a god, I plant seeds and nurse the soil from which the scene grows. The primary methods used so far is to organize a lot of parties, maintain codebase64.org, creating a music editor for others to use, and telling others what to do. ;)</Trivia>

<Trivia>Interestingly I began my relationship with the scene in a more obscure way than the usual scener, as Hacker/Phreaker and a member of the North American H/P community (I seldom chatted with Aussie H/P's back in those days). Of course, like most, I started playing games to begin with, but soon started meddling with other things; conferences, systems, boards, social engineering and calls to foreign countries to people with similar interests was fascinating for me (late 1980s). I started swapping and progressed to the status of Mega-Swapper (200+ contacts) (early-mid 1990s). Due to my connections with the English game companies I soon became a very popular Original Supplier (supplying in excess of 300 'first release' originals); this was perhaps my second most important role as a member of a cracking group (the first being H/P and supplying my group 'calling codes').

The other main tasks I have performed is organiser (Public Relations and Management), Magazine Editor (Wetworks, Vandalism, Domination, The Pulse, Scene+, Driven and now my new magazine called Recollection), co-sysop of &amp;lt;bbs id=95&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;bbs id=36&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;bbs id=94&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;bbs id=254&amp;gt; and several other C64 bulletin boards. Also HTML-slave with updates to scene sites on the internet ([url=http://www.atlantis-prophecy.org/onslaught]The Forbidden Depths[/url], [url=http://www.atlantis-prophecy.org/mags]Ultimate C64 Scene Mag Archive[/url] and [url=http://www.atlantis-prophecy.org/recollection]Recollection Online[/url]) and graphician (did quite a lot of graphics in my younger days, including some paper art in the form of disk covers and votesheets).
