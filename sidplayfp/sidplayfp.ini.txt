NAME
    sidplayfp.ini - Configuration file for sidplayfp(1).

DESCRIPTION
    This page describes the options available for the configuration file of
    Sidplayfp. It is composed by a number of sections, each one composed by
    a section name, enclosed by square brackets, followed by a list of
    <parameter>=<value> lines.

    sidplayfp.ini supports the following sections:

    [SIDPlayfp] - Generic configuration

    [Console] - Console appearance configuration

    [Audio] - Audio output configuration

    [Emulation] - Emulation engine parameters

    All options and values are described in detail below.

    For any of the following parameter, if it's specified more than one time
    the last entry encountered will be used.

    NOTE: if any of these options is specified outside its section, it will
    be *ignored*.

  SIDPlayfp
    Version=*<number>*
        Configuration version

    Songlength Database=*<path>*
        Full path for the Songlength DB. By default the program will look
        for a file named DOCUMENTS/Songlengths.txt under the HVSC collection
        path, if the HVSC_BASE environment variable is defined. On *NIX
        systems, if this value is not set, sidplayfp(1) will try
        $PREFIX/share/sidplayfp/Songlengths.txt.

    Default Play Length=*mm:ss*
        Default play time if Songlength Database is not found.

    Default Record Length=*mm:ss*
        Default recording time when writing wave files if Songlength
        Database is not found.

    Kernal Rom=*<path>*
        Full path for the Kernal Rom file. This is the most important rom
        and should always be provided, although many tunes will still work
        without. By default the program will look for a file named kernal
        under the following locations:

        *   $XDG_DATA_HOME/sidplayfp/

            on *NIX systems where XDG_DATA_HOME is defined.

        *   $HOME/.local/share/sidplayfp/

            on *NIX systems where XDG_DATA_HOME is not defined.

        *   $PREFIX/share/sidplayfp

            on *NIX systems when not found in the above directories.

        *   %CSIDL_APPDATA%\\sidplayfp\\

            on Windows systems where CSIDL_APPDATA is defined.

        *   %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\sidplayfp\\

            on Windows systems where CSIDL_APPDATA is not defined.

    Basic Rom=*<path>*
        Full path for the Basic Rom file. This is mostly useful for playing
        BASIC tunes. By default the program will look for a file named basic
        under the same locations as above.

    Chargen Rom=*<path>*
        Full path for the Character generator Rom file. Almost useless for
        playback of tunes, but included for completeness. By default the
        program will look for a file named chargen under the same locations
        as above.

  Console
    Ansi=*true|false*
        Use ANSI escape sequences to provide colored output.

    Char Top Left=*<char>*
        Character for the top left corner.

    Char Top Right=*<char>*
        Character for the top right corner.

    Char Bottom Left=*<char>*
        Character for the bottom left corner.

    Char Bottom Right=*<char>*
        Character for the bottom right corner.

    Char Vertical=*<char>*
        Character for vertical lines.

    Char Horizontal=*<char>*
        Character for horizontal lines.

    Char Junction Left=*<char>*
        Character for left junctions.

    Char Junction Right=*<char>*
        Character for right junctions.

  Audio
    Frequency=*<number>*
        Playback frequency expressed in Hertz. Default is 48000.

    Channels=*<number>*
        Number of channels, 1 for mono and 2 for stereo playback Default is
        1.

    BitsPerSample=*<16|32>*
        Number of bits ber sample, used only for wav output. Using values
        other than the ones specified will produce invalid output.

  Emulation
    Engine=*<RESIDFP|RESID|HARDSID|EXSID|NONE>*
        Set the SID emulation engine. Default is RESIDFP.

    C64Model=*<PAL|NTSC|OLD_NTSC|DREAN>*
        Default c64 model to use if not specified by tune, PAL for european
        PAL-B model, NTSC for american/japanese NTSC-M models, OLD_NTSC for
        NTSC-M models with old video chip and DREAN for argentinian PAL-N
        model. Default is PAL.

    ForceC64Model=*true|false*
        Force the configured c64 model even if the tune specifies one.

    CiaModel=*<MOS6526|MOS8521>*
        Select CIA chip model, old MOS 6526 or newer MOS 8521.

    SidModel=*<MOS6581|MOS8580>*
        Default SID chip model, old MOS 6581 or newer MOS 8580.

    ForceSidModel=*true|false*
        Force the configured SID chip model even if the tune specifies one.

    DigiBoost=*true|false*
        Enable digiboost for 8580 model.

    UseFilter=*true|false*
        Enable/disable the emulation of the SID filter.

    FilterBias=*<number>*
        Controls the filter bias in the ReSID emulation. The bias is given
        in millivolts, and a maximum reasonable control range is
        approximately -500 to 500, the default value is 0.

    FilterCurve6581=*<number>*
        Controls the filter curve for the 6581 model in the ReSIDfp
        emulation. Ranges from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark), the default value
        is 0.5.

    FilterCurve8580=*<number>*
        Controls the filter curve for the 8580 model in the ReSIDfp
        emulation. Ranges from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark), the default value
        is 0.5.
