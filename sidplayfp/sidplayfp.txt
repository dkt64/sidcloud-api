NAME
    sidplayfp - a C64 and SID chip emulator for playing Commodore 64 music.

SYNOPSIS
    sidplayfp [*OPTIONS*] *datafile*

DESCRIPTION
    Sidplayfp is a music player that emulates various components from a
    Commodore 64 (C64) computer. The result is a program which can load and
    execute C64 machine code programs which produce music and sound.
    Sidplayfp has been designed for accuracy which results in a quite high
    cpu usage. Additional playback modes have however been provided to allow
    playback on low specification machines at the cost of accuracy.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display help.

    -f*<num>*
        Set audio output frequency in Hz (default: 48000).

    -nf No filter emulation. This will reduce CPU overhead at the cost of
        reduced emulation quality.

    -o*<num>*
        Select track number (default: preset).

    -s  Stereo playback. If the tune is identified as stereo then sid 1 and
        2 become the left and right channels respectively.

    -v*[num]*
        Verbose output while playing.

    -b*<num>*
        Set start time in [mins:]secs format (compatible with sid2wav).

    -ds*<addr>*
        Force dual sid environment by adding a second chip at specified
        address. This forces emulation of 2 sid-chips for stereo playback
        even if datafile is identified as only being mono. This occurs in
        the case of the stereo prg format as currently there is no way to
        identify them. Stereo MUS and SID files are however automatically
        detected. The second sid may be installed in the 0xD420-0xD7FF or
        0xDE00-0xDFFF address range. Address may be specified in exadecimal
        (e.g -ds0xd420) or decimal (e.g. -ds54304) format.

    -ts*<addr>*
        Add a third chip at specified address. The sid may be installed in
        the 0xD420-0xD7FF or 0xDE00-0xDFFF address range. Address may be
        specified in exadecimal (e.g -ts0xd440) or decimal (e.g. -ts54336)
        format.

    -u*<num>*
        Mute a channel. May be used more than one time. Channel 1 to 3 are
        for the first SID chip while channels from 4 to 6 are for the second
        one and 7 to 9 for the third.

    -p*<num>*
        Set bit precision for file saving. The default is 32 (32 bit float),
        but can be set to 16 to create 16 bit signed samples. Other values
        will cause invalid output.

    -o*<l|s>*
        Option 'l' will select continuous track looping while 's' will
        select the current track instead of all. This option can be combined
        with the track selection to form -ols<num>.

    -q  Quiet output while playing (opposite of verbose).

    -t*<num>*
        Set play length in [mins:]secs format (0 is endless).

    -v*<n|p>[f]*
        Set VIC clock speed. 'n' is NTSC (America, 60Hz) and 'p' is PAL
        (Europe, 50Hz). Providing an 'f' will prevent speed fixing that
        tries to compensate automatically for the speed difference. Removing
        speed fixing simulates what happens on a real C64. Options can be
        written as: -vnf or -vn -vf.

    -m*<o|n>[f]*
        Set SID chip model. 'o' is the old 6581 and 'n' is the new 8580.
        Providing an 'f' will force the selected model overriding the one
        specified by the tune.

    --digiboost
        Enable digiboost for 8580 model.

    -r*<i|r>[f]*
        Set resampling mode. 'i' is interpolation (less expensive) and 'r'
        resampling (accurate). Providing an 'f' will provide faster
        resampling sacrificing quality. Fast resampling is available only
        for reSID emulation. Options can be written as: -rif or -ri -rf.

    -w, --wav*[name]*
        Create WAV-file. The default output filename is <datafile>[n].wav
        where [n] is the tune number should there be more than one in the
        sid. This allows batch conversion of sid tunes without them
        overwriting each other. By providing a name it is possible to
        override this default behavior. The output file will be <name> with
        no tune number added and <name> IS NOT checked for or appended with
        a legal wav file extension.

    --au*[name]*
        Create AU-file. The default output filename is <datafile>[n].au.

    --resid
        Use VICE's original reSID emulation engine.

    --residfp
        Use reSIDfp emulation engine.

    --hardsid
        Use HardSID device.

    --exsid
        Use exSID device.

Key bindings
    1-9 Mute/unmute voice.

    f   Toggle filter.

    p   Pause/unpause playback.

    Esc Quit player.

    Up/Down Arrows
        Increase/reset playback speed.

    Left/Right Arrows
        Move to previous/next subtune.

    Home/End Arrows
        Go to first/last subtune.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        will be loaded from here and relative SID tune paths are accepted.
